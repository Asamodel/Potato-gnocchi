### **RECIPE**


1. Use potatoes of a fairly even size, as you’re going to cook them whole. Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender.
2. Drain and leave until cool enough to handle, then remove the skins.
3. Mash the potatoes using a potato ricer or masher on to a large clean board.
4. Sprinkle over the flour, finely grate over half the nutmeg, season well with sea salt and black pepper, then scrunch and push the mixture together
5. Knead on a flour-dusted surface for a few minutes until pliable
6. then divide into 4 equal pieces and roll each into a pita bread about 2cm thick.
7. Slice into 3cm lengths – this is your basic gnocchi. Now you can gently roll each piece down a butter pat, the back of a fork or a fine grater to add grooves, which will help your sauce to stick, or simply roll into balls.
8. Cook in a pan of boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes – as soon as they come up to the surface they’re ready.
9. Remove with a slotted spoon and toss with melted butter , finely grated parmesan and tomato puree. serve with some extra cheese on top for better taste
